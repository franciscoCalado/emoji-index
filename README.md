## Overview

This project was done as a challenge for Bliss Applications. It is based on the MVP architecture and uses RxJava2 to ensure a reactive paradigm and Dagger 2 to handle dependency injection. It also uses Retrofit to handle network calls and Room as a database solution to store data. As an image loading solution I used Glide.

## What's missing

Testing: Unit and integration tests;

UI consitency: 
- Use themes and styles to uniformize the UI (as well as choose a better color scheme);
- Make the app more responsive to orientation changes (grids look terrible in portrait now);
